Louisville,2013,13:11,p 36,2013_Louisville_SUS,"The plan includes adaptive management techniques that would allow MSD to utilize green infrastructure, or natural solutions such as vegetated roofs, in-ground stor- age, rain gardens and pervious pavement, to accomplish the same level of control for sewer overflow reduction. The intent of MSD’s Green Infrastructure program is to re- duce the amount of stormwater overflow through natural solutions, thus reducing gray project sizes and costs, and signaling a new era in stormwater management in Louis- ville. Gray projects are the traditional systems of building storage capacity in tanks or other holding structures that simply hold the rainwater during a rain event and thereby reduce the overflow volumes. MSD also completed 19 green demonstration projects, which are being used as testing grounds for monitoring and modeling. The long- term performance of green infrastructure will be docu- mented, including the amount of stormwater runoff
captured, maintenance cycles, stormwater infiltration rates and ultimately CSO volumes.
In 2011, MSD launched a Green Incentives and Savings Program, which established financial incentives for com- mercial and industrial private property owners to help offset green infrastructure construction costs, as well as provide an opportunity for credits on stormwater fees for a period of time. The incentives are based upon a busi- ness case where the value of removing impervious surface area from the combined sewer system was calculated and quantified by accounting for reduced gray project sizes, and the cost to treat stormwater.
PROPOSED INITIATIVES
To promote green infrastructure practices citywide, the Office of Sustainability will investigate opportunities to collaborate with MSD to expand its incentive program. The program will encourage use of green infrastructure in both redevelopment and new development areas which may be outside of MSD’s priority incentive area.

LEAD: GENERAL SERVICES
The City currently owns 311 parks in Detroit, many of which have not had capital improvements in more than ten years. In 2017, General Services and Parks and Recreation created a strategic plan to improve the City’s parks and recreation centers. As the first phase of this plan, we invested $11.7 million to renovate 40 neighborhood parks and created three new parks, adding over 12 acres of parkland to our system. Over the next ten years, we will renovate 99 existing parks and will create 18 new parks, including developing eight multisport parks, spending over $100 million in capital improvement funds.
These parks were selected based on several key criteria, including which parks had the highest concentrations of children and senior citizens living nearby. Renovations will include new playgrounds, equipment, walkways, landscaping, and the installation of new sports facilities. All of these improvements will enable residents, young and old, to become and stay active. One of the major improvement strategies is to offer residents more natural parkland opportunities to address the relatively low percentage of parkland in the city that is natural open-space compared to active recreational parkland.",Create,Parks,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Oklahoma,2020,167:8,p 88,2020_Oklahoma_SUS,"Use highly reflective roofing materials when constructing new or replacing roofing on City facilities. Whether amidst a densely-developed area or surrounded by impervious surfaces, large roofs can be used to deter the intensity of urban heat islands. Whether new construction or retrofit, alternative roofs can reflect rather than absorb thermal radiation and thereby limit increases of ambient air temperature.
Such alternatives include light-colored, highly reflective materials or paint to boost albedo; vegetative or “living” roofs; planters to accommodate urban agriculture; or photovoltaic solar arrays.",Use,Green roofs,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
Oklahoma,2020,167:10,p 88,2020_Oklahoma_SUS,"Preserve trees and expand shade cover.
Preserving mature trees is a vital step in realizing the ecological service and public health benefits now and in the future. Removing mature trees not only visibly alters the landscape, but can also drastically affect drainage and effects of the urban heat island. Activities on both public land should prohibit mature tree removal and private developments should be incentivized to preserve mature trees.
Vegetative cover and trees in particular will reduce the effects of the urban heat island and provide additional storm water and air quality benefits. Programs such as the Arbor Day Foundation’s Energy-Saving Trees provide a platform for organizing tree-planting initiatives that assists property owners in siting prospective trees where they will block heat-gain from direct sunlight and maximize energy efficiency gains. Shade structures should be encouraged in areas where tree growth is not feasible.","Preserve, Expand",Trees-focused,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
